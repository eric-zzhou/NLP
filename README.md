# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### Medium folder includes all code written following [30 day NLP course](https://medium.com/coders-mojo/day-1-30-days-of-natural-language-processing-series-with-projects-b29211d5450c) by Naina Chaturvedi.
### NLTK folder includes all code written following the online [NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/).
### Other folders and files are projects and code made by me. I am trying to gain a better understanding of NLP and its uses so I can apply it to my own projects.
